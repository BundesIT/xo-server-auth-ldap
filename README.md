> LDAP authentication plugin for XO-Server

## Install

Installation of the [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/xo-server-auth-ldap):

```
> npm install xo-server-auth-ldap
```

## Usage

To enable this plugin you have to add it into the configuration file
of XO-Server:

```yaml
plugins:

  auth-ldap:
    uri: "ldap://ldap.example.org"

    # Credentials to use before looking for the user record.
    #
    # Default to anonymous.
    bind:

      # Distinguished name of the user permitted to search the LDAP
      # directory for the user to authenticate.
      dn: 'cn=admin,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org'

      # Password of the user permitted to search the LDAP directory.
      password: 'secret'

    # The base is the part of the directory tree where the users are
    # looked for.
    base: "ou=people,dc=example,dc=org"

    # Filter used to find the user.
    #
    # Default is `'(uid={{name}})'`.
    #filter: '(uid={{name}})'
```

## Algorithm

1. If `bind` is defined, attempt to bind using this user.
2. Searches for the user in the directory starting from the `base`
   with the defined `filter`.
3. If found, a bind is attempted using the distinguished name of this
   user and the provided password.
